## Problem Solving Tips

* Understand the problem
  * What is the problem asking?
  * Restate the problem in your own words
  * Sketch the problem
  * describe all knowns and unknowns
  * separate problem into smaller problems
* Make a plan
  * Guess, check, adjust
  * Eliminate possibilities
  * Use symmetry
  * Consider an extreme cases
  * Consider a specific example
  * Consider a simpler problem
  * Consider a harder problem
  * Consider a similar problem
  * Look for a pattern
  * Draw a picture
  * Work backward
  * Use a model
  * Make a list, table, or chart
  * Use a formula
  * Be creative
* Do the plan
  * Solve
* Reevaluate solution
  * Reflect, review, redo
