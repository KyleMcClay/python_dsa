##Breadth-First Search
<img src="https://kylemcclay.github.io/python_dsa/images/BFS.jpg" alt="Broken" class="inline"/>

- Breadth-First Search
  - searches information by exploring each node closest to the starting point
  - visually: imagine roots branching out
 - Data structure used is a queue

##Depth-First Search

- Depth-First Search
 - searches information by exploring each path one by one.
 - visually: imagine spikes coming one by one
 - Data structure used is a stack

```python

```
